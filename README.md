# Automation of MacOS system installation/config

_This is a work in progress_

## What's inside?

All installed packages and applications can be found in `Brewfile`. Application specific scripts (`./scripts/setup-*.sh`) contain further installations.

## How to use

All scripts (`./scripts/*.sh`) can be executed separately, and `./run.sh` executes them all. Scripts should not produce errors when ran again.
